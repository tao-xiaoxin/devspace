# DevSpace Workflow

## What This Skill Does

Use this skill when the user drives DevSpace with concise workflow messages such as `/plan`, `/goal`, skill names, or compact answers to pending questions.

## Before Starting

1. Confirm you already have a `workspaceId` for the active project.
2. If there is no open workspace, call `open_workspace` first.
3. Reuse the same `workspaceId`; do not reopen the same folder unless it stops working or the user explicitly asks.
4. Keep replies short and operational unless the user asks for explanation.

## Workflow Modes

### Plan Workflow

Trigger on messages like:

- `@dev /plan ...`
- `/plan ...`

Use `resolve_skill("/plan")` first, then follow the returned `create-plan` instructions. Treat `/plan` as an alias, not a native slash command.

### Goal Workflow

Trigger on messages like:

- `@dev /goal ...`
- `/goal ...`

Use `resolve_skill("/goal")` first, then follow the returned `define-goal` instructions. If the user explicitly wants a lightweight persisted goal record, use `create_goal`, `get_goal`, and `update_goal` after the goal is well-defined.

### Compact Answers

Trigger when there is pending `request_user_input` state and the user replies with compact text such as `1B，2A`, `1B, 2A`, or `1b 2a`.

Prefer passing the raw reply through `handle_workspace_command` only for compact answer parsing, or directly through `answer_user_input(text)`, instead of paraphrasing it.

### Batch File Changes

When the user asks for broad or multi-file modifications, prefer `apply_workspace_patch` with a unified diff patch instead of shell redirection, heredocs, generated scripts, or ad-hoc write commands.

### Git Push

When the user explicitly asks to push commits, prefer `git_push` with structured `remote`, `branch`, and `setUpstream` arguments instead of `bash` with a raw `git push` command.

## Response Standard

- Bottom line first.
- Prefer action over explanation.
- For simple workflow steps, return a short status.
- Do not explain slash semantics or MCP mechanics unless the user asks.
