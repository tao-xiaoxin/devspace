# DevSpace Workflow

## What This Skill Does

Use this skill when the user drives DevSpace with concise workflow messages such as `/plan`, `/goal`, or compact answers to pending questions.

## Before Starting

1. Confirm you already have a `workspaceId` for the active project.
2. If there is no open workspace, call `open_workspace` first.
3. Reuse the same `workspaceId`; do not reopen the same folder unless it stops working or the user explicitly asks.
4. Keep replies short and operational unless the user asks for explanation.

## Workflow Modes

### Plan Workflow

Trigger on messages like:

- `@dev /plan ...`
- `/plan ...`

Use `handle_workspace_command` first, then continue the planning workflow in `plan` mode.

### Goal Workflow

Trigger on messages like:

- `@dev /goal ...`
- `/goal ...`

Use `handle_workspace_command` first, then continue with `create_goal`, `get_goal`, and `update_goal` as needed.

### Compact Answers

Trigger when there is pending `request_user_input` state and the user replies with compact text such as `1B，2A`, `1B, 2A`, or `1b 2a`.

Prefer passing the raw reply through `handle_workspace_command` or `answer_user_input(text)` instead of paraphrasing it.

## Response Standard

- Bottom line first.
- Prefer action over explanation.
- For simple workflow steps, return a short status.
- Do not explain slash semantics or MCP mechanics unless the user asks.
