[![DevSpace connected to ChatGPT](docs/assets/devspace-screenshot.png)](docs/assets/devspace-screenshot.png)

**Give ChatGPT a secure connection to your own machine and Turn ChatGPT into Codex**

DevSpace is a self-hosted MCP server that lets ChatGPT read, edit, search, and run code in your real local projects — your files, your tools, your terminal — without uploading anything to a third party. You run it on your machine, expose it through a tunnel you control, and approve the connection with a password only you have.

## Installation

DevSpace requires Node `>=20.12 <27`. Node 22 LTS is recommended.

Install the DevSpace CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @waishnav/devspace
```

Then initialize and start the server:

```bash
devspace init
devspace serve
```

Or run it without a global install:

```bash
npx @waishnav/devspace init
npx @waishnav/devspace serve
```

During setup, DevSpace asks for:

- the local project folders ChatGPT is allowed to open through DevSpace
- the local port, usually `7676`
- your public HTTPS base URL from Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, Pinggy, Tailscale Funnel, or
  another reverse proxy

Use the public origin without `/mcp` during setup:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com
```

You will configure your MCP client with the public `/mcp` URL after setup.

When the client connects, DevSpace opens an Owner password approval page. Enter
the Owner password printed by `devspace init`. It is also stored in:

```text
~/.devspace/auth.json
```

Keep that password private.

## Connect Your MCP Client

The default local endpoint is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:7676/mcp
```

Most users should connect through a public HTTPS tunnel:

```text
https://your-tunnel-host.example.com/mcp
```

## Configuration Management

Update the local server config with short commands:

```bash
# Show the effective runtime configuration
devspace config show

# Change the local listening port
devspace config port 7676

# Change the local bind host
devspace config host 127.0.0.1

# Set the public domain or URL
devspace config domain devspace.example.com

# Rotate the Owner password
devspace config key
```

Configuration changes are saved immediately. If a managed DevSpace background
service is currently running, DevSpace automatically restarts it so the new
settings take effect right away.

`devspace config show` displays the effective bind host, port, MCP path, public
URL, workspace list, service state, and a masked access key. If the current
Owner password comes from `DEVSPACE_OAUTH_OWNER_TOKEN`, DevSpace masks and shows
that effective value instead of reporting it as missing.

`devspace config key` rotates the existing DevSpace Owner password, clears saved
OAuth approvals and tokens, and forces connected clients to reauthorize.

## Workspace Management

Persist the workspace roots DevSpace is allowed to open:

```bash
# Add a workspace and mark it as the default one
devspace workspace add ~/workspace/project-a --default

# Add another workspace without changing the default
devspace workspace add ~/workspace/project-b

# Show configured workspaces
devspace workspace list

# Switch the default workspace
devspace workspace default ~/workspace/project-b

# Remove a workspace from the allowlist
devspace workspace remove ~/workspace/project-a
```

You can also allow extra paths for one run only:

```bash
devspace serve --add-dir ~/scratch/project-c --workspace ~/workspace/project-b
```

Workspace paths are the authorization boundary for DevSpace and MCP file tools.
Adding a workspace authorizes only that path and its children.

If you start DevSpace without any configured workspaces or `DEVSPACE_ALLOWED_ROOTS`,
DevSpace now fails closed: the server can start, but workspace access is denied
until you explicitly add an allowed path.

## Service Management

DevSpace service management only manages DevSpace itself. `devspace service start`
acts as the single entrypoint: if the background service is missing, DevSpace
creates it for the current platform and starts it; if it already exists, it
just starts it. It does not manage arbitrary system services.

```bash
# Start the managed DevSpace background service
devspace service start

# Show whether the service is installed and running
devspace service status

# Read the service log output
devspace service logs

# Restart the running service
devspace service restart

# Stop the running service
devspace service stop

# Disable automatic service startup
devspace service disable

# Remove the installed DevSpace background service
devspace service remove

# Check service-manager support and current health
devspace service doctor
```

Platform behavior:

- macOS uses a per-user LaunchAgent.
- Linux and Ubuntu use a per-user systemd service when available.
- Windows uses Task Scheduler.
- WSL prefers user systemd and otherwise reports a Windows Task Scheduler fallback.

DevSpace does not automatically configure DNS, reverse proxies, TLS
certificates, or firewall rules.

## What ChatGPT Can Do

Once connected, ChatGPT can open one of your approved project folders as a
workspace. From there, it can inspect the repo, make scoped edits, run commands,
and show you what changed.

DevSpace gives ChatGPT tools to:

- read, write, and edit files inside the opened workspace
- search code and inspect directories
- run shell commands for tests, builds, git, and package scripts
- use isolated Git worktrees for parallel coding sessions
- follow project instructions from `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
- discover local agent skills from your skill folders
- show tool cards and optional change summaries in ChatGPT Apps-compatible hosts

DevSpace bundles durable workflow Skills rather than short prompt examples. Core Skills cover project Plan recovery, Goal definition and status, workflow resumption, architecture review, and Skill authoring.

Project Skill directories are split by purpose:

- `skills/.system`: exactly five DevSpace-owned system Skills: `plan`, `goal`, `workflow`, `architecture-review`, and `skill-authoring`
- `skills/local`: project-defined Skills you want to keep in version control
- `skills/installed`: user-installed external Skills, ignored by git by default

ChatGPT Plus on the web cannot natively install or register Codex Skills. DevSpace provides MCP-side discovery, resolution, and controlled `skill://` resource access instead.

`@devspace /plan` and `@devspace /goal` are stable alias-style workflow conventions. `/plan` always resolves to system `plan`; `/goal` always resolves to system `goal`; local, installed, and global Skills cannot silently override them. `skills/.system/README.md` records the system Skill policy and change log.

## Using `/plan` and `/goal`

Use these aliases in a normal ChatGPT message after DevSpace is connected. They are not native ChatGPT slash commands. Open the workspace first, then state the requested outcome clearly.

### `/plan`: inspect first, then save an implementation plan

Use `/plan` when you want repository analysis and a durable implementation plan before any file changes. DevSpace loads the current Plan when one exists, enters Plan Mode, inspects the repository read-only, then persists a Plan with ordered steps, validation, risks, and a revision number.

```text
@devspace Open /path/to/project.

/plan Add a hello CLI command that prints "Hello DevSpace".
First inspect the project and create a persistent Plan.
Do not modify project files or run commands that write to the repository.
```

A good `/plan` request states the outcome, relevant constraints, and whether implementation should wait for approval. To review a saved Plan later, ask DevSpace to open the same workspace and read the current Plan before taking action.

```text
@devspace Open /path/to/project.

Read the current Plan and summarize its title, revision, pending steps, validation, and blockers. Do not modify files.
```

### `/goal`: keep a durable outcome across sessions

Use `/goal` when an objective should remain available across future DevSpace sessions. A Goal records the objective, scope, success criteria, verification, stop conditions, current status, and exact metrics where evidence exists. DevSpace reads the active Goal first and will not silently replace it with a competing one.

```text
@devspace Open /path/to/project.

/goal Create a durable Goal to add a hello CLI command.
Success criteria: the command runs and prints "Hello DevSpace".
Verification: run the command and its automated test.
Stop condition: the project requirements change to a non-CLI interface.
Do not modify files yet.
```

You can explicitly start or pause the Goal work timer, or update its status when work is blocked, completed, or archived.

```text
@devspace Start the current Goal work timer.

@devspace Pause the current Goal work timer and show the measured work duration.
```

### Using them together

Create a Goal for the long-lived outcome, then create a Plan that breaks the Goal into concrete steps and explicitly links the Plan to that Goal. Goal progress is calculated only from completed steps in that linked Plan; DevSpace does not guess a percentage. Provider token metrics are recorded only when an API/provider returns real token usage and a stable request ID, so ChatGPT web usage is not filled in automatically.

```text
@devspace Create a Plan for the current Goal, link the Plan to the Goal, and save it without modifying files.
```

Manage installed skills with:

```bash
# Install a skill for the current context
devspace skills install --repo openai/skills --path skills/.curated/research

# Install a skill for one specific workspace
devspace skills install --workspace /path/to/project --repo openai/skills --path skills/.curated/research

# List skills for the current context
devspace skills list

# List skills for one specific workspace
devspace skills list --workspace /path/to/project

# Remove a skill from the current context
devspace skills remove research

# Remove a skill from one specific workspace
devspace skills remove --workspace /path/to/project research

# Install a global skill
devspace skills install -g --repo openai/skills --path skills/.curated/research

# List global skills
devspace skills list -g

# Remove a global skill
devspace skills remove -g research
```

`--repo/--path` and `--local-path` must point directly at one standard skill directory that contains `SKILL.md`. Repository roots, plugin roots, command folders, and agent-rules directories are rejected.

## Project Workflow Store

DevSpace stores compact project-scoped workflow state: the current Plan, Goal, Plan Mode, structured step state, and at most 100 concise workflow events. It does not store chat transcripts, raw tool output, shell logs, or file snapshots. Goal metrics are limited to exact provider-reported token records, an explicit server work timer, and progress derived from a Plan explicitly linked to that Goal.

The same canonical project directory shares Plan and Goal state across ChatGPT sessions and DevSpace restarts. Different projects and different Git worktree roots remain isolated. `open_workspace` returns a small `workflowDigest`; call `get_plan`, `get_goal`, and paginated `get_workflow_history` only when full state is needed.

Plan and Goal writes use optimistic concurrency. Read the current state first, then send `expectedRevision`; stale sessions receive a revision conflict instead of silently overwriting newer work.

## Mental Model

DevSpace is remote access to selected local folders.

You decide which roots are allowed. The MCP client still has powerful local
capabilities inside an opened workspace, including shell execution. Treat a
connected client like a trusted coding partner with access to your machine.

For a normal ChatGPT coding session:

1. Start your tunnel.
2. Run `devspace serve`.
3. Connect the MCP client to your public `/mcp` URL.
4. Approve the connection with the Owner password.
5. Ask ChatGPT to open a project inside one of your allowed roots.

## Platform Support

DevSpace supports Linux, macOS, and Windows environments with a Bash-compatible
shell for the main CLI, and supports native per-user service control on macOS,
Linux, Windows, and WSL.

## Philosophy

Every piece of software is becoming conversational. Natural language is
redefining how we interact with tools, workflows, and systems.

My bet is that ChatGPT becomes the operating system for everything. Once we
reach AGI, we will simply talk to ChatGPT, and it will prompt, coordinate, and
orchestrate sub-agents that set up the right loops for us.

We are not there yet.

DevSpace is one attempt to fast-forward that future: a way for MCP-capable
hosts like ChatGPT and Claude to work directly with local project files through
explicit, inspectable tools.
